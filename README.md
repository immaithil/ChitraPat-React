This is a single page application made by using React. You can add and watch pictures on it. It has two pages one is for rendering photos and when you will click on the '+' icon then you will visit the next page and ager submitting the image link and adding description to it you will be moved again to previous page with a new image added to it.


## File structure
To deploy this application use the build folder. There are other two main folders

`Public folder contains the main file i.e. index.html.
All the other components related to the application are inside the source folder.
I have imported all the component files inside the index.js file will is anchored to index.html of public folder.

## Tech stack
The main liberary which is used here is React js. I have installed it form npm and then added the component and functionality according to requirement from my side. I am currently learning React so I will count it as my first mini project in React.
